Coding Question:

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Explanation:

Main condition -->  if(checkValidity(root.left, left, root) &&  checkValidity(root.right, root, right))
By this condition we are defining the minimum and maximum value of the subtrees.
Check the code to understand the answer. Try to imagine the flow and try to find how we are defining the left and right limits of the subtrees.
